{"name":"RubyMotion Cookbook","body":"# rubymotion_cookbook #\r\n\r\n\r\nRubyMotion iOS Cookbook is our project to learn RubyMotion, iOS development, and to provide a valuable community\r\nresource of code examples. We're experts in none of these things so if you have a suggestion, be gentle, it's\r\nour first time. This is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nWe'll be following along with the actual *[iOS5 Programming Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021728.do)*\r\n by Vandad Navandipoor from O'Reilly, \r\nstarting with chapter two, and porting over the Obj-C code examples as we progress through the book. If you have\r\nthe book and want to add to the project or if we've made an error, send us a pull request, we'll gladly accept the help! If you love butterflies and rainbows and can't resist telling us, just save that for a private message.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we're aware that [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/mattetti/BubbleWrap) and similar libraries exist and we're intentionally avoiding them. Wrapping difficult Cocoa libraries with elegant Ruby is a great idea, but we're attempting to map our examples 1:1 to the cookbook so that the body of the text remains relevant and using an external resource defeats that purpose. Plus, those libraries aren't very mature yet, the vanilla API access will always be relevant.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Code examples for iOS development with RubyMotion.","google":"UA-31655235-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
